# Avern Studio

Content management for games created with the [Avern Engine](https://github.com/nsmarino/avern-frontend).

A halfway point between interactive 3d worlds made with Blender, and the websites where you visit them.

Read through the [Sanity docs](https://www.sanity.io/docs/overview-introduction) to learn how to use this studio.
